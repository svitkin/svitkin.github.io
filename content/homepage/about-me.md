Hi! I'm a software engineer with 10+ years building and shipping products. I've worked across government, large enterprise, and start-up environments, and I also have experience as a data scientist and engineer I can leverage in ML/AI projects.

I love collaborating and care about making the best possible tool for users, whether they're internal or external. No problem is too ambiguous or big enough that we can't work together to scope it down and make it real. Reach out to me [here](https://calendly.com/svitkin32/30min) to see if I can help!
