Hi! I'm a software engineer with 10+ years building and shipping products. I've worked across government, large enterprise, and start-up environments. As a former data scientist, I can bring valuable insights to your ML/AI projects.

I love collaborating and making the best possible tool for users, whether they're internal or external. No problem is too ambiguous or big enough that we can't work together to scope it down and make it real. Reach out to me {{<extlink text="here" href="https://calendly.com/svitkin32/30min">}} to see if I can help!
