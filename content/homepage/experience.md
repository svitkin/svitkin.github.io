- Led the user research, design, and full-stack implementation (from cloud infrastructure to frontend reporting) of a web application that helps teachers plan their curriculum.

- Managed data pipelines that orchestrated the extraction of structured output from text using LLMs, and combined that with ML classification model output and external API calls. All data was transformed in transparent, traceable steps that fed into a final set of schemas. 

- Over the course of a month, migrated user data securely without any interruption in experience to the end-user.

- Automated microservice creation with backend templates, increasing team productivity and speed of development.
